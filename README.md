# Syllabus-Intro-Microeconomics

This is the syllabus for my introductory microeconomics course at Portland State University.  My course is only taught once or twice a year.  What makes the course interesting is that I don't do multiple choice.  The majority of the class is based on homework questions that require a deep dive by the student and then peer debriefs of student answers.
