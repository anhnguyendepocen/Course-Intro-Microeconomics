# Half Week?

+ Why we have only one module this week.  There will be two next week.
+ The next modules on perfect competition trough monopoly are the hard ones in the class.
+ We are currently about two weeks behind the usual for in-person courses.

# Exercise 1 (Groups)

Give three examples, with context, of:
+ Fixed input/cost
+ Variable input/cost

Give the reason why you think the input/cost is variable or fixed.

Nominate a speaker.

# A few Rules on costs

+ FC is fixed
+ $TC = VC + FC$
+ $VC(0) = 0$
+ $AC = AVC + AC = \frac{TC}{Q} = \frac{VC}{Q} + \frac{FC}{Q}$
+ $MC(Q) = TC(Q+1) - TC(Q) = VC(Q+1) - VC(Q)$ The non-calc definition varies by textbook.  Caution.

# Exercise 2 (Whole Class)

Fill in the blank and say why.

Q    | TC      | VC    | FC   | AC   | AFC   | AVC | MC  |
---  |---      |---    |---   |---   |---    |---  |---  |
0    |  2      |       |      |      |       |     |  3  |
1    |  5      |       |      |      |       |     |     |
3    |  12     |       |      |      |       |     |     |


# Exercise 3 (Groups)

Q    | TC      | VC    | FC   | AC   | AFC   | AVC | MC  |
---  |---      |---    |---   |---   |---    |---  |---  |

# About the diagrams

You tend to see two kinds in the book:

1.  Linear Marginal Cost ($MC = \alpha q$): 
  + $AVC = \frac{\alpha}{2} q$
  + Profit maximizing is just where lines cross.
1. Parabolic Average variable cost ($AVC  = \alpha (q - m)^2 + b$)
  + Shows the increasing marginal product of labor, declining marginal cost range.
  + Infinities for low q.
  
# Getting Diagrams Right is Key   

You need to be able to see the relationships.

+ The steps and graphical hints are mostly to help you see the basic relationships.
+ There are a few mathematical requirements, e.g., MC cuts AC at the min of AC, but otherwise the hints are to give you enough space to see areas.
+ The order is different depending if you are drawing linear marginal cost or parabolic AVC.


# Steps: Linear Marginal

+ Axis with labels.  $ or costs list, AC, MC, etc and q/t is fine.
+ Draw in MC as a line with zero intercept
+ AVC line half as steep as MC with intercept at zero.
+ AC is hard:
  + AC = AFC + AVC
  + Starts far above AVC since AFC is large for small q.
  + Gets closer to AVC as q increases
  + Is cut by MC at the minimum.
  + Looks like a skewed parabola

# Steps: Parabolic AVC

+ Axis with labels.  $ or costs list, AC, MC, etc and q/t is fine.
+ Draw AC as a smile that covers about 2/3 of your graph. 
+ MC looks like a fish hook or Nike Swoosh that cuts AC at the minimum.
+ AVC is hard:
  + AC = AFC + AVC
  + Starts far below AC since AFC is large for small q.
  + Gets closer to AC as q increases
  + Is cut by MC at the minimum.
  + Looks like a skewed parabola
