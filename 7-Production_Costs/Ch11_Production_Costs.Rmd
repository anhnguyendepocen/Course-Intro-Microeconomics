## Goals

+ Create a taxonomy, i.e., a categorization, of productive inputs
+ Show a general pattern of production and why those patterns happen.
+ Use a production function to derive common cost functions: AC, MC, AVC, AFC, etc.


Warning: Things will be getting mathy and graphy.

## The Hot dog Stand

+ Actual hot dog stand on the Santa Cruz Boardwalk in the 70s.
+ Really small
+ Very experimental person running it.


## The Stand and Things in it


## Inputs

+ All the things, tongs, bottles, buns, kimchi, are *inputs*.
+ Those divide into two groups:

    + *Fixed inputs*, Capital (K): Don't change when output changes.  Are uncorrelated with output. (The building, tongs, steam trays, ...)
    + *Variable inputs*, Labor (L): Change when output changes.  Are correlated with output.(The buns, kimchi, mustard, people working,...)
    
We will bundle the variable inputs into one and call it labor minutes.  "Labor" and "Capital" are convention.

## Add People and Plot What is Made


## Observe

+ No variable inputs, no outputs.
+ Add variable inputs and output goes up, but eventually falls.
+ Each worker add more to output than the previous for a while.
    + Increasing *marginal product of labor*
    + For calc people $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} > 0$
+ Each worker then adds more to output, but the increase of each new worker is less than the last.
    + Decreasing *marginal product of labor*
    + For calc people $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} < 0$
+ Ignore the part where we make output go down.  It is silly.

## Why Increasing and Decreasing $MP_L$?

+ Increasing $MP_L$, output increaseses and last added adds **more** than the previously added.
    + Less idle capital but labor in constant motion.
    + More specialization.
    + Learning by doing (Slightly off)

+ Decreasing $MP_L$, output increases and last added adds **less** than the previously added.
    + No idle capital but labor not in constant motion.
    + No more gains from specialization on this scale.
  
## Our Clean Idealized Production Function


## Lets Turn this Into Costs

+ Invert production function, $f(input) = output$ to get **inverse production** function, $f^{-1}(output) = input$.
+ Multiply inverse production function by price of variable input, wages, $w$ to produce **variable cost function**, $wf^{-1}(output) = w input = VC(output)$.
+ Add cost of fixed inputs, $r$, to produce **total costs**, $VC(inputs) + rK = VC(output) + rK = VC(output) + FC = TC(Output)$

## Inverting with Mirrors and Pipe cleaners


## Multiply by Stretchering

## Add by Sliding


## Great, but We Need More

+ Eventually we will find the output that maximizes profit.  
+ Calc people know that means take a derivative.
+ Will do this graphically but we need more cost functions.

## The Average Family

$$\frac{g(x)}{x} = Average~G~Function$$

+ Will put a variety of costs in for $G$.
+ AFC: Average fixed cost
+ AVC: Average variable cost
+ AC or ATC: Average Cost or Average Total Cost

## The Marginal

+ For calc people, $\frac{\partial TC}{\partial q} = \frac{\partial TC}{\partial q} = MC(q)$
+ For non-calc, the **additional** costs required to produce one more.


## Cord from Origin Trick on AFC


## Construct AVC


## Construct AC

## Construct MC

## All the Average/Marginal at Once

## Key Features

+ AC generally like a smile but can have other shapes IRL
+ Mark the min of AC
+ MC looks like a Nike swoosh/fish hook that cuts min of AC.
+ AVC is less than AC, is cut at min by MC, and gets closer and closer to AC as output increases. ***THIS IS THE HARD PART***
+ Note hidden AFC, the vertical distance between AC and AVC.

## A Few Rules

+ FC is fixed
+ $TC = VC + FC$
+ $VC(0) = 0$
+ $AC = AVC + AC = \frac{TC}{Q} = \frac{VC}{Q} + \frac{FC}{Q}$
+ $MC(Q) = TC(Q+1) - TC(Q) = VC(Q+1) - VC(Q)$ The non-calc definition varies by textbook.  Caution.
