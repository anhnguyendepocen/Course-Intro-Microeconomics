## The Vote

"I want to take the final exam."

+ If you vote **NO**:
    + Grades are calculated based on all existing grades.
    + Your current rank determines your grade.
    + About ~30% As, ~30% Bs, ~12% Cs and the rest other.

A NO must be unanimous to pass.  If there is one YES, we take the exam. This is an anonymous vote.
