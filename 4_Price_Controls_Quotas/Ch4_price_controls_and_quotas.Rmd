## What are We Talking About

+ Price Ceilings and Floors
    + *Legal* minimum or maximum price
    + Minimum wage (Legal Min)
    + Rent control (Legal Max)
    
+ Quantity Ceilings and Floors
    + Legal minimum and maximum purchase or sale
    + Tricky because it can be per purchase or in aggregate.
        + Minimum purchase or sale (Auto Insurance)
        + Maximum purchase quantity (See local ganja store for example)

## A Few Warnings

+ This is about messing with well functioning, perfectly competitive markets. 
+ You generally don't want to touch those.


But ...

## We Should if They are Not

+ Markets that are non-competitive in some way
    + Low skill - low wage labor, minimum wage laws (Economists are split on this but evidence is coming in)
    + Labor markets in general (There may be few buyers and buyers may have more information)
    + Monopoly power, internet service etc.
+ When there are externalities
    + Pollution, congestion and the like, but other mechanisms often work better
    + Common resource like fishing.  Again, different approaches may be better.
    
    
## We Do Mess with Markets for Other Reasons

+ Critical industry (Argument currently in use for auto tariffs and price floors on milk)
+ Infant industry (Just let it grow so we don't have to import)
+ Protect the poor (Cheap food)
+ Ensure quality (UK had a minimum price of gin)


## Why We Care in Macro?

+ We do this on vast scales.
    + Quotas on large industries (autos, oil)
    + Tariffs
+ The vast scales don't restrict themselves to a single industry they have macro, unemployment, growth, and inflation, effects.


##  Warnings

+ The analysis that follows assumes that we are constraining well functioning markets.
+ You can improve the functioning of *some* markets with constraints, but not all.
+ The constraints break prices ability to allocate, so other non-price allocation mechanisms, like discrimination, kick in.

## Price Ceiling

## Summary of Price Ceiling

+ Quantity demanded is larger than quantity supplied -- a shortage.
+ The usual equilibrium mechanism, bidding up price, can't work.
+ Those that can buy at the low price get a lot of benefits.
+ Those that can't end up either:
    + Not getting the goods
    + Buying a close substitute
    + Waiting for a non-price allocation mechanism to kick in.
    
## Real Example: Rent Control

Anne was trying to move to Berkeley and I tried to help.

+ Many don't get to buy
+ Some get imperfect substitutes -- Oakland.
+ Information becomes valuable, since prices no longer transmit information
+ Discrimination
+ Queues
+ Connections to other markets arise
+ Administrative Allocation
+ Lottery


## Price Floor

## Summary of Price Floor

+ Quantity Supplied is larger than quantity demanded -- a surplus.
+ The usual equilibrium mechanism, bidding down price, can't work.
+ Those that can sell at the high price get a lot of benefits.
+ Those that can't end up either:
    + Not selling
    + Selling a close substitute
    + Waiting for a non-price allocation mechanism to kick in.


## Real Example: Airlines Before Deregulation

+ Many don't get to sell
+ Some get imperfect substitutes -- Bus and car.
+ Information becomes valuable, since prices no longer transmit information
+ Discrimination
+ Queues
+ Connections to other markets arise
+ Administrative Allocation
+ Lottery

## Quantity Floor


![](StartConstraints.png)


## Summary of Quantity Floor

+ Price could be high or low depending on who is constrained, who must buy or sell.
    + If buyers must buy, price is high
    + If sellers must sell, price is low

In short, the unconstrained party, buyer or seller, bids the price up or down.
