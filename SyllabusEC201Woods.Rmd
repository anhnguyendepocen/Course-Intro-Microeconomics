# Course Description



## Key Dates

+ Final Exam: August 16th from 4:30 -- 6:50
+ Midterm 1: July 17th
+ Midterm 2: August 7th

Exams will be given on those days and at those times only.  I do not give make up, early or late exams.  The final is required.  You will recieve a failing grade if you don't take it.

If you have a DRC compensation and would normally schedule an exam in the testing center, you must schedule your exam on the day of the exam such that you finish your exam at 5pm.

# Contact Information

Communication will be handled through slack https://ec314summer18.slack.com. You should have received an invitation, if not, just go to that URL and use your @pdx.edu email to sign up. There are reasonable help documents to get you started. https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users

Slack will be used for IM, email and forum style communication.  It even handles phone calls. If you have a question about course material or the course itself, ask in one of the channels. If you have a personal message that is not intended for others, send a direct message. The group has global do not disturb hours of 10pm - 8am.  If you would like something different, alter your personal settings.

Please note that I am not online all the time, and when I am online I will prioritize well-phrased questions with sufficient detail.  I tend to ignore general complaints, questions that can be answered by reading the syllabus or using the search bar.  

I will not react to questions in the day prior to an exam  under most circumstances. I am just trying to protect my workload from student procrastination.  *If your study strategy is to cram the night before, you are on your own.* 


Office Hours:

+ My office is in CH 241-O.
+ Drop in office hours are Tues 3:00-4:00  through the last week of class. There is no need to make an appointment for these hours -- just come.
+ If you can’t attend regular office hours, please check my calendar https://woodsj.youcanbook.me/. I will make a limited number of 15 minute slots available each week. If you make an appointment and fail to show up without first canceling, I will penalize your final exam score two points.  


My in-person office hours may need to be moved to a different location because of construction in Cramer Hall.

### Netiquette
Since we will be having some online interaction, we should be clear
about what we should and should not do.

In class, I can see what is going on at all times.  In the online
environment, I can't see everything and I can't react as quickly to
what I do see.  Students are expected to be particularly trustworthy
both in terms of their own conduct, and in reporting inappropriate
conduct to me.

I will not tolerate profanity, obscenity, or remarks intended to
discount or dismiss either a person or his or her point of view. If your inappropriate message is in the public forum, I will warn you
once in that public space. If you continue with inappropriate conduct
in the public spaces, your access to them will be denied for the rest
of the term. If your inappropriate conduct is in private, a student code of conduct violation complaint may be filed. 
 
### D2L


# Assessments and Grade Policy

Your grade in the class will be based on your performance on the midterms and the final exam.  

+ Final Exam (30%)
+ Midterm 1 (30%)
+ Midterm 2 (30%)
+ In-class quizzes and Class Rules D2L Quiz (10%)

The quizzes in D2L are not part of your grade, except as noted below, but you will be hard pressed to pass the class without spending significant time with the material.

Course grades will be based on class rank with cut points between letter grades determined by gaps in the distribution.  Note that the exams are required. Not attending an exam will result in a failing grade.

# Other Rules

+ Please be aware that federal, state, and PSU policies require faculty members to report any instances of sexual harassment, sexual violence and/or other forms of prohibited discrimination. Similarly, PSU faculty are required to file a report if they have reasonable cause to believe that a child with whom they come into contact has suffered abuse, or that any person with whom they come into contact has abused a child. If you would rather share information about these experiences with an employee who does not have these reporting responsibilities and can keep the information confidential, please contact one of the following campus resources (or visit https://www.pdx.edu/sexual-assault/get-help):

    + Women’s Resource Center (503-725-5672)
    + Queer Resource Center (503-725-9742)
    + Center for Student Health and Counseling (SHAC): 1880 SW 6th Ave, (503) 725-2800
    + Student Legal Services: 1825 SW Broadway, (SMSU) M343, (503) 725-4556

    For more information about the applicable regulations please complete the required student module Creating a Safe Campus in your D2L.


+ Begging for grades will result in an immediate lowering of your course grade by a full letter grade.
  
+ When completing online quizzes or other assignments, you may use your book, wiki, calculator, spreadsheets, notes, or other resources as long as it is not another student or person.  *The work must be authentically and genuinely your own. In other words, if you are copying answers you found online, it is not your work.*

+ Go to office hours at the first sign of trouble -- not as a last resort.

+ In this classroom, we support and value diversity.  To do so requires that we:

    + Respect the dignity and essential worth of all individuals
    + Promote a culture of respect toward all individuals
    + Respect the privacy, property, and freedom of others
    + Reject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any kind
    + Practice personal and academic integrity and expect it from others
    + Promote the diversity of opinions, ideas, and backgrounds, which is the lifeblood of a university

    For additional information, please see the Office of Affirmative Action \& Equal Opportunity at http://www.pdx.edu/diversity/affirmative-action.


+ Accommodations are collaborative efforts between students, faculty, and the Disability Resource Center.  If you have a documented disability and require accommodation, you must arrange to meet with the course instructor prior to or within the first week of the term.  The documentation of your disability must come in writing from the Disability Resource Center (Faculty letter).  

+ PSU values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to fostering mutual respect and full participation for all students. My goal is to create a learning environment that is equitable, useable, inclusive, and welcoming. If any aspects of instruction or course design result in barriers to your inclusion or learning, please notify me. The Disability  Resource Center (DRC) provides reasonable accommodations for students who encounter barriers in the learning environment. 

    If you have, or think you may have, a disability that may affect your work in this class and feel you need accommodations, contact the Disability Resource Center to schedule an appointment and initiate a conversation about reasonable accommodations. The DRC is located in 116 Smith Memorial Student Union, 503-725-4150, drc@pdx.edu, https://www.pdx.edu/drc.

+ Academic honesty is expected and required of students enrolled in this course.  Suspected academic dishonesty in this course will be handled according to the procedures set out in the Student Code of Conduct.

+ I am sympathetic to family emergencies but you must inform me as soon as possible. If the notice is verbal, please email me with your understanding of our agreement. All agreements have to be in writing.
